# Acquia Drupal Spec Tool

[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/acquia/drupal-spec-tool.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/acquia/drupal-spec-tool) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acquia/drupal-spec-tool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acquia/drupal-spec-tool)

This project provides a tool for specifying Drupal architecture details and generating automated tests for them. It consists of 1) a Google Sheet for capturing specification and generating tests from it and 2) the Behat contexts that automate the generated tests.

## Getting started

### Google sheet

Copy [the current version of the Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h-SieCV9Dtrj8F4bqMvsbcHwIibN30j2oR9FMRDFT-8/edit?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive.

### Behat tests

Assuming you already have [Behat installed](http://behat.org/en/latest/quick_start.html#installation) via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)...

1. Install the Behat contexts:

    _Note: If you're using [BLT](https://github.com/acquia/blt) the Drupal Spec Tool is already included as part of `blt/composer.suggested.json`._

    ```bash
    composer require --dev acquia/drupal-spec-tool
    ```

1. Add the new contexts to your [Behat configuration](http://behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration.html), e.g.:

    ```yaml
    # behat.yml
    default:
      suites:
        default:
          contexts:
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\AccessControlContext
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\ContentModelContext
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\MediaContext
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\MenuContext
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\ViewsContext
            - Acquia\DrupalSpecTool\Context\WorkflowContext
    ```

1. Create a [Behat feature](http://behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/features_scenarios.html) file for each generated feature on the "Behat" tab of the Google sheet (e.g., `content_model.feature`) and copy the Gherkin into it. (See [Advanced](#advanced) below to automate this process.)

1. Run Behat! If the tests pass, your application already matches the specification. If not, change one or the other according to your needs.
